# Project Overview: Autosweep Revamp

Autosweep Revamp is an open-source initiative dedicated to transforming the existing [Autosweep Mobile App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.balanceinquiry) into a modern application that fully embraces Material 3 Expressive design principles.

Please note that this is an independent, open-source project and is not an official application. We are not directly affiliated with the original Autosweep app developers; we are simply using the current Autosweep application as a reference point to showcase modern Android development and design.
